# Data 102 Fall 2023 Website

This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azPPK5aOcV0) walks you through how to make changes to the website (just replace all instances of fa19 with fa23 and DS100 with Data 102).

To add Jupyter notebook links to the webpage, use nbgitpuller: https://jupyterhub.github.io/nbgitpuller/link

The following text is taken from the standard GitHub Pages README.


You can use the editor on GitHub to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run Jekyll to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Running Locally
This website is written using Jekyll Bootstrap with some modifications to improve support for github pages.

Install `rvm`: https://rvm.io/ or `rbenv`: https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv. Personally, `rbenv` might work better for me.

Install Ruby 2.2.0:

``rvm install 2.2.0``

Clone this repo:

``git clone https://github.com/ds-102/fa23.git``

In the repo directory, run:

``gem install bundler``
``bundle install``

Finally, serve the project locally with:

``jekyll serve``

This will start the local Jekyll server at http://localhost:4000.
